paint5.1
======

paint5.1 is the same as paint5, just using jQuery for some of the event handling.
The major changes from paint5:
1) the layout has been changed
2) the event handling is through jQuery
3) the code has been compartmentalized into CSS, JS, and HTML files
Some notes:
1) the problem about the mousemove paint event being too slow still exists. I'm workin' on it
2) I'm working on an eraser. I thought I could simply draw over the content on the canvas with the
backgorund color, but I don't suppose so. For now, the eraser is broken.
